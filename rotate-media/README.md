# Rotate Image or Video
Gyroscopes are sometimes more precise than we would like. Depending on how you hold your device when capturing a picture (which is not always ideal), a portrait picture might sometimes be captured in landscape orientation, and vice versa. Especially when capturing images of documents. This shortcut reduces the multi-step process of rotating an image/video in iOS to just 2 taps. 

# Setup
1. Import the shortcut into your shortcuts app
2. Add shortcut to share sheet following these [steps](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/launch-a-shortcut-from-another-app-apd163eb9f95/ios)

# How to use
1. Select the image/video from Photos, click on share and tap on the shortcut in the share sheet
2. Select degrees to rotate the image/video. Shortcut will save a copy of rotated image and will ask whether you wish to delete the original.
