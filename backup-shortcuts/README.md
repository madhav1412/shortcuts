# Backup Shortcuts
Shortcuts app only has a sync functionality as of creating this shortcut. It lacks a backup/recover function. This shortcut addresses this issue.

# How it works
1. Backs up all shortcuts to the chosen directory.
2. Deletes backups older than 30 days.

# Setup
1. Manually run the shortcut once to allow permissions
2. Enable Delete Without Asking in Privacy screen of the shortcut settings (Click i button when shortcut is opened)
3. Can be assigned to an [Automation](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/enable-or-disable-a-personal-automation-apd602971e63/ios) for regular backup
