# Missed Reminders
The iOS Reminders app follows a "set it and forget it" approach, without an option to remind you again later in case you forget to clear the reminder. This shortcut ensures you stay on top of your tasks by repeatedly notifying you about any unchecked reminders.

# Setup
Enhance this shortcut by attaching an automation that runs at your desired time intervals each day. It will send notifications listing the names of any uncompleted reminders, keeping you on track effortlessly.
